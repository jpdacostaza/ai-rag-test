## 🛠️ Key Components Status

### Memory API Endpoints (http://localhost:8003)
```bash
# Health & Info
GET  /health                    # Service health check
GET  /                         # API information

# Memory Operations  
POST /api/memory/remember      # Store new memories
POST /api/memory/forget        # Delete memories (query/forget_query)
GET  /api/memory/retrieve      # Query memories (also accepts POST)
GET  /api/memory/stats         # System/user statistics
GET  /api/memory/interactions  # Interaction history
GET  /api/memory/debug         # Debug information
```

### Core Files Present
- `enhanced_memory_api.py` - Main memory API (21.7KB)
- `storage/openwebui/memory_function_working.py` - OpenWebUI integration (20.3KB)
- Complete test suite with 4 test files
- Docker configuration with 6 services
- All storage directories and data files intact
