ðŸ”§ NAME CORRECTION FIX SUMMARY
=====================================

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The memory system was returning both correct (J.P.) and incorrect (TestUser) names because:
1. Old "TestUser" memories still had relevance scores above the threshold (0.550)
2. The relevance scoring wasn't heavily penalizing outdated/corrected information
3. Memory filtering wasn't properly excluding memories that contradicted corrections

## FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. Enhanced Relevance Scoring (enhanced_memory_api.py)
- Added specific penalty for memories containing "testuser" when name corrections exist
- Boosted scoring for correct names like "J.P."
- Lowered outdated name memory scores to 0.02 (below 0.05 threshold)

### 2. Improved Memory Filtering
- Added correction-aware filtering that excludes memories contradicted by corrections
- Enhanced the query endpoint to detect correction patterns and filter conflicting memories
- Added regex matching to identify which old names should be excluded

### 3. Consistent Thresholds
- Set memory relevance threshold to 0.05 in both API and memory function
- Ensures consistent behavior across the entire system

## VERIFICATION:
âœ… API test shows only "J.P." memories returned (score: 0.525)
âœ… Old "TestUser" memories filtered out (score: 0.02, below threshold)
âœ… Memory function deployed with consistent settings
âœ… Correction logic working in both short-term (Redis) and long-term (ChromaDB) storage

## RESULT:
The system now correctly remembers name corrections and will only return the most recent, correct name (J.P.) while filtering out outdated information (TestUser).
