üîß EXPLICIT MEMORY MANAGEMENT STATUS
=====================================

## COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Enhanced memory API with name correction fixes working perfectly
‚úÖ Memory function updated with explicit command detection patterns  
‚úÖ Added explicit_remember() and explicit_forget() methods to memory function
‚úÖ Added command detection logic for patterns like "remember that...", "forget about..."
‚úÖ Created request models (ExplicitMemoryRequest, ForgetMemoryRequest)
‚úÖ Memory function integration with explicit commands in inlet() method
‚úÖ Test scripts created for both name correction and explicit memory management

## CURRENT ISSUE:
‚ùå New API endpoints (/api/memory/remember, /api/memory/forget) not registering properly
   - Endpoints added to enhanced_memory_api.py but not showing in route list
   - Container restarts successfully but endpoints return 404
   - No syntax errors in file, compiles successfully

## FUNCTIONALITY STATUS:
üü¢ Name corrections: WORKING (J.P. vs TestUser fixed)
üü° Explicit memory commands: PARTIALLY WORKING (function-level detection works, API endpoints need fixing)

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix API endpoint registration issue
2. Test complete explicit memory flow (remember/forget commands in OpenWebUI)
3. Verify memory persistence across sessions

## HOW IT WORKS (when fixed):
User says: "Remember that I love pizza on Fridays"
‚Üí Memory function detects "remember" command
‚Üí Calls explicit_remember() API endpoint  
‚Üí Stores memory directly (bypasses extraction)
‚Üí Responds with confirmation

User says: "Forget about pizza"
‚Üí Memory function detects "forget" command
‚Üí Calls explicit_forget() API endpoint
‚Üí Searches and deletes matching memories
‚Üí Responds with deletion count

## PATTERNS SUPPORTED:
Remember: "remember that...", "don't forget...", "keep in mind...", "note that..."
Forget: "forget about...", "delete...", "remove...", "erase...", "clear..."
