# Docker Container Startup Fix - Conversation Handover

## Date: July 1, 2025
## Commit: 8cf3f89 - Fix Docker container startup issues and add human logging

## Problem Solved
**Main Issue**: Docker container was failing to start with "exec format error" when running the startup script.

### Root Cause
The startup script (`scripts/startup.sh`) had Windows line endings (CRLF) which prevented execution in the Linux container environment.

### Solution Applied
1. **Line Ending Conversion**: Converted `scripts/startup.sh` from CRLF to LF using PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   (Get-Content scripts/startup.sh) -join "`n" | Set-Content scripts/startup.sh -NoNewline
   ```

2. **Missing Module**: Created `human_logging.py` module that was being imported by `config.py`

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/startup.sh`
- **Issue**: Windows line endings causing exec format error
- **Fix**: Converted to Unix line endings (LF)
- **Status**: ✅ Container now starts successfully

### 2. `human_logging.py` (NEW FILE)
- **Purpose**: Service status logging functionality
- **Content**: Provides `log_service_status()` function for application logging
- **Integration**: Required by `config.py`

### 3. `Dockerfile`
- **Context**: Already properly configured with user permissions and directories
- **Status**: Working correctly with the fixed startup script

### 4. `docker-compose.yml`
- **Context**: Service configuration for llm_backend
- **Status**: Ready for container deployment

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Docker image builds successfully (70+ seconds build time)
- Container starts without exec format error
- Startup script executes and checks dependencies
- Directory permissions set correctly for `llama` user
- FastAPI initialization begins

### ✅ RESOLVED - Container Now Running Successfully
The container startup issues have been fully resolved:

**Latest Fix Applied**: 
- **Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'web_search_tool'`
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive `web_search_tool.py` with web search functionality
- **Additional**: Restored missing files from Backup folder:
  - `memory_filter_function.py`
  - `memory_function.py` 
  - `watchdog.py`

**Current Status**: ✅ Container running successfully on port 9099

## Test Commands
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t backend-llm_backend .

# Test container startup
docker run --rm -p 8001:8001 backend-llm_backend

# Simple test
docker run --rm backend-llm_backend echo "Container starts successfully"
```

## Technical Details

### Build Process
- Base image: `python:3.11-slim-bookworm`
- PyTorch: CPU-only version installed
- Dependencies: All requirements.txt packages installed
- User: Runs as `llama` user (UID 1000)
- Working directory: `/opt/backend`

### Startup Process
1. Dependency verification
2. Storage directory setup
3. Permission configuration
4. FastAPI server initialization on port 9099

### Environment Variables
- CPU-only execution enforced
- Cache directories properly configured
- Threading limited to prevent resource conflicts

## Previous Debugging Steps
1. Identified exec format error in container logs
2. Tested startup script existence and permissions
3. Discovered line ending issue through hex dump analysis
4. Applied line ending conversion fix
5. Rebuilt container successfully
6. Verified container startup sequence

## Git Repository State
- Branch: `the-root`
- All changes committed and pushed
- Ready for continued development

## Recommendations for Next Session
1. Continue with any remaining application startup issues
2. Test full application functionality
3. Verify all API endpoints work correctly
4. Consider adding health checks to docker-compose
5. Document any additional configuration requirements
