# Workspace Organization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the workspace reorganization completed on June 22, 2025, where test files and documentation were properly organized into dedicated folders.

## Files Moved to `demo-test/` Folder

### Test Files
- `test_*.py` - All test scripts for various components
- `*investigation*.py` - Investigation and debugging scripts
- `*debug*.py` - Debug utilities and scripts
- `live_*.py` - Live system testing scripts
- `edge_case_test.py` - Edge case testing
- `demo_*.py` - Demo and example scripts
- Cache and cleanup related test files

### Specific Files Moved
- `test_search_endpoint.py` - Search endpoint testing
- `test_enhanced_logging.py` - Enhanced logging tests
- `test_step_by_step.py` - Step-by-step debugging
- `semantic_search_investigation.py` - RAG investigation
- `debug_numpy_issue.py` - NumPy debugging (now resolved)
- `chromadb_investigation.py` - ChromaDB connection testing
- And many more test and debugging utilities

## Files Moved to `readme/` Folder

### Documentation Files
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Session documentation
- All existing documentation and reports

## Core Files Remaining in Root

### Production Code
- `main.py` - Main FastAPI application
- `app.py` - Application entry point
- `database.py` & `database_manager.py` - Database operations
- `rag.py` - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- `upload.py` - File upload handling
- `model_manager.py` - Model management
- `ai_tools.py` - AI tool integrations
- `error_handler.py` - Error handling utilities
- `human_logging.py` - Logging system
- `storage_manager.py` - Storage management
- `watchdog.py` - Health monitoring
- `cache_manager.py` - Cache management

### Feature Modules
- `adaptive_learning.py` - Adaptive learning system
- `enhanced_document_processing.py` - Document processing
- `enhanced_integration.py` - Integration features
- `enhanced_streaming.py` - Streaming enhancements
- `feedback_router.py` - Feedback handling
- `cpu_enforcer.py` - CPU mode enforcement
- `verify_cpu_mode.py` - CPU verification
- `force_refresh.py` - Refresh utilities

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - Only production code remains at the root level
2. **Organized Testing** - All test files are in `demo-test/` for easy access
3. **Centralized Documentation** - All markdown files are in `readme/` folder
4. **Better Maintainability** - Clear separation between production and testing code
5. **Improved Navigation** - Easier to find specific types of files

## Recent Fix Summary
The NumPy array comparison error that was causing memory operation failures has been completely resolved. The semantic search system now works without errors, and comprehensive debug logging has been implemented throughout the pipeline.

### Additional Fix - Multi-modal Content Support
Fixed a Pydantic validation error in the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint that was preventing multi-modal requests (text + images) from being processed correctly. The endpoint now properly extracts text content from complex multi-modal message structures sent by OpenWebUI.

**Error Fixed:**
```
1 validation error for ChatRequest
message
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=[{'type': 'text', 'text':...}], input_type=list]
```

**Solution:** Updated the message extraction logic to handle both simple string content and complex multi-modal content structures containing text and image data.
