# Debug Files Directory

This directory contains all debug, testing, and development files that were created during the development process of the memory pipeline system for OpenWebUI integration.

## Contents

### Core Debug Files
- `debug_chat_storage.py` - Debug script for chat storage functionality
- `debug_endpoints.py` - Debug script for API endpoint testing
- `debug_pipeline.py` - Debug script for pipeline functionality
- `debug_time_parsing.py` - Debug script for time parsing issues

### Memory Pipeline Tests
- `test_memory_flow.py` - Test script for memory flow functionality
- `test_openwebui_memory.py` - Test script for OpenWebUI memory integration
- `test_openwebui_memory_fixed.py` - Fixed version of OpenWebUI memory test
- `comprehensive_memory_test.py` - Comprehensive memory system test
- `verify_memory_pipeline.py` - Pipeline verification script

### Pipeline Implementations
- `simple_test_pipeline.py` - Simple test pipeline for debugging
- `memory_pipeline_fixed.py` - Fixed version of memory pipeline

### Endpoint Validation
- `endpoint_validator.py` - Script to validate API endpoints
- `focused_endpoint_validator.py` - Focused endpoint validation script

### Demo and Test Directories
- `demo-test/` - Contains various demo and test files
- `demo-tests/` - Additional demo test files

### Other Debug Files
- `database_fixed.py` - Fixed version of database module
- `setup_api_keys_demo.py` - Demo script for API key setup

## Purpose

These files were created during the development and debugging process to:
1. Test individual components of the memory pipeline system
2. Debug integration issues with OpenWebUI
3. Validate API endpoints and data flow
4. Prototype different approaches to memory persistence
5. Troubleshoot Docker container communication

## Usage

These files are kept for reference and future debugging but are not part of the main application. They can be safely ignored during normal operation of the memory pipeline system.

## Status

All files in this directory are considered archived debug materials as of the completion of the memory pipeline implementation project.
