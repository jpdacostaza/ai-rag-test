ðŸ“‹ Manual Memory Function Import Guide
=========================================

Since the automated import is having API issues, let's import the function manually through the OpenWebUI interface:

## Step 1: Copy the Function Code
1. Open the file: memory_filter_function.py
2. Select all the code (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C)

## Step 2: Import via OpenWebUI Interface
1. In your browser, go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click on your profile (top right) â†’ Admin Settings
3. Navigate to: Functions (in the left sidebar)
4. Click: "Import Function" or "+" button
5. In the import dialog:
   - ID: memory_filter
   - Name: Memory Filter
   - Type: filter
   - Paste the copied code in the content area
   - Description: Memory filter that adds context from previous conversations
6. Click "Import" or "Save"

## Step 3: Enable the Function
1. After import, find "Memory Filter" in the functions list
2. Toggle it to "Enabled" (should be a switch/toggle)
3. Make sure "Active" is set to true

## Step 4: Assign to Model
1. Go to: Models (in the left sidebar)
2. Find your model (e.g., "llama3.2:3b")
3. Click on it to open settings
4. Look for "Filters" or "Functions" section
5. Add "Memory Filter" to the model
6. Save the model settings

## Step 5: Test Memory Functionality
1. Start a new chat with the model
2. Ask: "Remember that I like pizza"
3. In a new conversation, ask: "What do you know about my food preferences?"
4. The AI should remember the pizza preference from the previous conversation

## Troubleshooting
- If the function doesn't appear in the Functions list, check the browser console for errors
- If memory doesn't work, check that all Docker containers are running:
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```
- Verify memory API is accessible:
  ```
  curl http://localhost:8003/health
  ```

## Next Steps After Manual Import
Once the function is imported and working, we can:
1. Test the memory persistence across different chats
2. Adjust memory settings via the function's "Valves" (configuration)
3. Add more sophisticated memory features
4. Monitor memory API logs for debugging
