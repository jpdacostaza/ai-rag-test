## 📊 File Organization Summary

### Before:
- **Root directory**: 50+ mixed files (tests, demos, core app files)
- **Poor organization**: Hard to find specific test types
- **Cluttered structure**: Main app files buried among tests

### After:
- **Root directory**: Only essential application files
- **Organized structure**: 
  - `demo-test/model-tests/` - 7 model testing files
  - `demo-test/cache-tests/` - 10 cache testing files
  - `demo-test/integration-tests/` - 12 integration test files
  - `demo-test/debug-tools/` - 5 debugging utilities
  - `demo-test/demos/` - 3 demo scripts
  - `demo-test/results/` - 13 test result files
  - `readme/` - 6 documentation reports
